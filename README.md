# Install docker with a simple .sh

# How to Use This Script

Save the Script:

Create a new file (e.g., install_docker.sh) and paste the script into it.

Make It Executable:
```
chmod +x install_docker.sh
```
Run the Script as Root:
```
sudo ./install_docker.sh
```
Log Out/In (If User Group Was Modified):

If you added a user to the Docker group, log out and back in so that group changes take effect.
